## High-Level Cheat Sheets

### Quick Triage Workflow

| Phase          | Debug Agent Action                                          | Developer Action                            | Outputs                                                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Initial Report | Run `*quick-debug` for rapid triage                         | Provide bug description, steps to reproduce | Initial assessment, severity classification             |
| Investigation  | Execute `*inspect` for comprehensive Fagan inspection       | Gather additional context as requested      | Detailed defect analysis with root cause identification |
| Root Cause     | Run `*root-cause` for fishbone analysis                     | Validate findings, provide domain knowledge | Root cause report with evidence trail                   |
| Fix Planning   | Execute `*validate-fix` to assess proposed solution         | Propose fix approach                        | Fix validation with risk assessment                     |
| Documentation  | Run `*debug-report` to generate comprehensive documentation | Review and approve report                   | Complete debug report for knowledge base                |

<details>
<summary>Execution Notes</summary>

- Use `*quick-debug` for initial triage and priority assignment
- Execute `*inspect` for systematic defect analysis using Fagan methodology (60-90% detection rate)
- Apply `*root-cause` when symptoms are clear but underlying causes need investigation
- Always run `*validate-fix` before implementing proposed solutions to assess risks
- Generate `*debug-report` to capture lessons learned and prevent similar defects

</details>

<details>
<summary>Worked Example – "Payment Processing Failure"</summary>

1. **Triage:** Developer reports payment failures in production. Diana runs `*quick-debug` and classifies as P0 (Critical).
2. **Inspection:** `*inspect` execution reveals race condition in transaction processing during Fagan Phase 4.
3. **Root Cause:** `*root-cause` identifies improper async/await handling as root cause (Technology/Process factors).
4. **Validation:** Developer proposes fix. `*validate-fix` confirms solution addresses root cause without side effects.
5. **Documentation:** `*debug-report` generates comprehensive report including prevention strategies.

### Complex Bug Investigation

| Phase            | Debug Agent Action                                           | Developer Action                                 | Outputs                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pattern Analysis | Run `*pattern-analysis` to identify systemic issues          | Review recent changes and feature additions      | Defect pattern report with trend analysis                       |
| Isolation        | Execute `*wolf-fence` for binary search debugging            | Assist with test execution and environment setup | Narrowed problem area with specific components identified       |
| Minimization     | Run `*delta-minimize` to reduce test case                    | Validate minimal reproduction case               | Smallest failing test case for efficient debugging              |
| Static Analysis  | Execute `*static-scan` for automated defect detection        | Address identified issues by priority            | Prioritized list of code smells, anti-patterns, vulnerabilities |
| Assertion Review | Run `*assert-analyze` for defensive programming improvements | Implement suggested assertions                   | Strategic assertion placement recommendations                   |

<summary>Execution Notes</summary>

- Start with `*pattern-analysis` when multiple related bugs occur
- Use `*wolf-fence` for large codebases where bug location is unclear
- Apply `*delta-minimize` when bugs require complex reproduction steps
- Execute `*static-scan` proactively as part of code review process
- Run `*assert-analyze` to prevent defensive programming gaps

## Knowledge Base

The debug agent uses a knowledge index system to load relevant information on-demand:

- **`debug-index.csv`** - Index of all knowledge fragments with tags and descriptions
- **`knowledge/debug-inspection-checklist.md`** - Systematic Fagan inspection checklist
- **`knowledge/root-cause-checklist.md`** - Fishbone methodology checklist
- **`knowledge/common-defects.md`** - Catalog of common defect patterns by type and severity
- **`knowledge/debug-patterns.md`** - Proven debugging strategies and detection methods

## Best Practices

1. **Systematic Approach:** Always follow proven methodologies (Fagan, fishbone) rather than ad-hoc debugging
2. **Evidence-Based:** Document all findings with clear evidence trails
3. **Root Cause Focus:** Don't stop at symptoms; identify and address underlying causes
4. **Prevention Oriented:** Generate recommendations to prevent similar defects
5. **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive debug reports for knowledge sharing
6. **Validation:** Always verify fixes against root cause and test for side effects

## Integration with Development Workflow

The Debug Agent integrates with the BMAD development workflow:

1. **Pre-Implementation:** Use `*assert-analyze` and `*static-scan` during code review
2. **During Development:** Apply `*quick-debug` for rapid issue triage
3. **Bug Investigation:** Execute `*inspect` and `*root-cause` for thorough analysis
4. **Fix Validation:** Run `*validate-fix` before merging
5. **Post-Release:** Use `*instrument` and `*pattern-analysis` for production monitoring

## Defect Severity Levels

- **P0 (Critical):** System unusable, data loss, security breach - Immediate response
- **P1 (High):** Major feature broken, significant impact - Within 24 hours
- **P2 (Medium):** Feature impaired, moderate impact - Within sprint
- **P3 (Low):** Minor issue, minimal impact - Next release
