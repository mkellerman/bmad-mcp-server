# Debug Knowledge Base

## Overview

This knowledge base contains systematic debugging methodologies, checklists, and reference materials for Diana, the Debug Specialist & Root Cause Analyst.

## Knowledge Fragments

### Core Debugging Resources

1. **debug-inspection-checklist.md** - Comprehensive Fagan inspection methodology with 6-phase systematic review process
2. **root-cause-checklist.md** - Fishbone analysis and 5-whys methodology for systematic root cause investigation
3. **common-defects.md** - Reference catalog of frequently occurring defect patterns with classification and prevention strategies
4. **debug-patterns.md** - Common debugging strategies, anti-patterns to avoid, and best practices

### Usage in Workflows

Each workflow references specific knowledge fragments:

- **Inspect Workflow** → Uses `debug-inspection-checklist.md` for systematic Fagan inspection
- **Root Cause Workflow** → Uses `root-cause-checklist.md` for fishbone and 5-whys analysis
- **Quick Debug Workflow** → Uses `debug-patterns.md` for rapid pattern recognition
- **Pattern Analysis Workflow** → Uses `common-defects.md` for defect classification
- **Static Scan Workflow** → Uses `common-defects.md` for automated defect detection

## Knowledge Integration

The debug-index.csv file maps knowledge fragments to specific use cases and tags, enabling efficient knowledge retrieval during debugging sessions.

## Maintenance

Knowledge fragments are maintained as part of the BMAD module structure and updated based on debugging experience and lessons learned from resolved incidents.
