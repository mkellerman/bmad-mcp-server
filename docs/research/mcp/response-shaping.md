# Response Shaping for LLM Actionability

- Front-load intent + summary
- Enumerate affordances before details
- Deduplicate repeated schema and descriptions
- Provide top-N results with explicit truncation markers
- Include compact metrics: token_estimate, sections, predicted_followups
- Offer next-step suggestions to reduce re-invocations
